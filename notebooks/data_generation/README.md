# Data generation (moved)

**Data generation notebooks have been moved** and run only in the genomenet project:

**`/Users/nicolaslynn/Documents/phd/projects/genomenet/data_generation`**

Copies of all notebooks and `DATA_GENERATION.md` are in that directory. The `.ipynb` files still in this folder are redundant; you can delete them from genebeddings. Generated outputs (CSVs, etc.) are consumed by this repo’s processing pipeline via `notebooks/processing/` and `paper_data_config`.
